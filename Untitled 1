TestNG - Test New Generation 

Java Based Testing Tool.

Advantage
1.Test Case & Test Suites
2.Grouping of Test Cases 
3. prioritize 
4. parameterization
5. parallel testing 
6. reports 


TestNG Conf

1. install testng in eclipse 
2. Add testng Libaray to build path / add testng dependency in pom.xml


@ Test - annotation 


1. TestNG executes test methods alphabetically if no priority is specified.
2.Use @Test(priority=num) to define execution order.
Priority can be any integer (positive, negative, or zero)
3.Only methods annotated with @Test are executed.



Annotation
-----
@Test  --- Methods with this annotation are executed as test cases.

@BeforeSuite --- Executed once before all tests in the suite.
@AfterSuite  --  Executed once after all tests in the suite.

@BeforeTest  -- Runs before any <test> in the TestNG XML file.
@AfterTest -- Executed after all test methods within a <test> tag are completed.

@BeforeClass --- Runs once before the execution of all test methods in the class.
@AfterClass  --- Executed once after all test methods in the class are completed.

@BeforeMethod  -- Runs before every test method.
@AfterMethod  -- Executed after every test method.

The general execution flow for these annotations is:

@BeforeSuite
@BeforeTest
@BeforeClass
@BeforeMethod
@Test
@AfterMethod
@AfterClass
@AfterTest
@AfterSuite


Parameterization

@DataProvider -- data driven Testing 

Assert
HardAssert -- Stops the execution of the current test method as soon as an assertion fails.

SoftAssert  -- Collects all assertion failures and reports them at the end of the test method.
